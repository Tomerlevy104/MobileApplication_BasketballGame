# Basketball Game - Mobile Applications Course Project

Welcome to my first game! In this exciting challenge, you'll need to dodge the defender and make sure they donâ€™t steal your ball.
This project is part of the "Mobile Applications" course at Afeka College and was developed as an Android-based mobile game using Android Studio.

## Project Overview

The game involves a **player** (represented by a basketball) that needs to avoid obstacles (represented by defense players) trying to steal the ball. The player must navigate the court and avoid the defenders, who move towards the ball in an attempt to steal it. The game is over when the player loses all lives due to collisions with the defenders.

The game is built using **Kotlin** and developed in **Android Studio**. The app makes use of UI components like buttons, image views, and timers to manage game logic, display obstacles, and update the ball's position.

### Technologies Used:
- **Programming Language:** Kotlin
- **IDE:** Android Studio
- **XML:** For designing UI layouts

    - Click on **Run > Run 'app'** (or press Shift + F10) to launch the game.

5. **Start Playing**:
    - Once the game is running, you can control the ball by pressing the **Left** or **Right** buttons to move it and avoid the defense players. Your goal is to survive and keep the ball away from the defenders.

## Game Instructions

- **Objective**: Control the basketball to avoid collisions with the defense players.
- **Control**:
    - Use the **Left** button to move the ball left.
    - Use the **Right** button to move the ball right.
    - Avoid the defense players who try to steal the ball.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when all lives are lost.

### Notes:
- The game has a timer that controls the movement of obstacles.
- Each time a defender successfully reaches the ball, a "bad collision" is recorded and a life is lost.
- The game displays a message when a collision occurs, and you can continue to play until all lives are lost.
